# Word Game Maze Project
This project was my final project for the week-long program (8/6/23-8/12/23) at UC Berkeley, CS Kickstart. 

Navigate through the maze using "WASD" to reach all 3 checkpoints and play the associated word games. Once all the checkpoints have been reached, reach the newly opened exit (E) to win!
"+" represents your current position, "." represents open pathways, "*" represents walls, and 1, 2, 3 are the checkpoints.

**Checkpoints**
1. Wordle -- The goal is to guess a randomly generated 5-letter word. If a valid guess is inputted, feedback will be returned with the accuracy of this guess.
 + "-" means that this guessed letter is not anywhere in the correct word.
 +  "+" means that this guessed letter is in the correct position and is the correct letter.
 + "=" means that this guessed letter exists somewhere in the correct word but is not in the correct position.

2. Alphabet -- The goal is to come up with 10 valid 5-letter words starting with a given letter.
3. Typing -- As a simple last obstacle, type given words accurately. Mistyping will decrease the score and temporarily freeze the game.
